# ðŸŒŸ Genshin Impact Wish Simulator Setup Guide

## Quick Setup Instructions

### 1. Create a New Directory
\`\`\`bash
mkdir genshin-wish-simulator
cd genshin-wish-simulator
\`\`\`

### 2. Initialize the Project
Copy all the files from the code project into your directory, then run:

\`\`\`bash
npm install
npm run setup
npm start
\`\`\`

### 3. Access the Application
Open your browser and go to: `http://localhost:3000`

## Troubleshooting

### If you get dependency errors:
1. Make sure you're in a fresh directory (not an existing React project)
2. Delete `node_modules` and `package-lock.json` if they exist
3. Run `npm install` again

### If you get SQLite errors:
- On Windows: You might need to install Visual Studio Build Tools
- On Mac: Make sure Xcode command line tools are installed
- On Linux: Install `build-essential` package

### Alternative SQLite Setup (if better-sqlite3 fails):
Replace better-sqlite3 with sqlite3 in package.json:
\`\`\`json
"sqlite3": "^5.1.6"
\`\`\`

Then modify the database code in server.js to use sqlite3 instead.
